`git checkout g1tc0d3` lets you view code from a previous commit.  use `git checkout master` to go back to your original code.
master should be just as you left it.


`git revert g1tC0d3` will remove everything done in selected commit and then replace it with whatever you want.
text below was left alone, even though it was commited after the reverted commit.  If you do with creating files, no issues, but with code I ran into error.



`git reset` completely removes the commits made after selected commit.  For me the lines that were targeted by reset were left in the editor, 
but were highlighted by VS Code.  items stay in editor,but are removed from the .git document.  They are not commited or known to git yet.
use `--hard` tag removes history from both browser and git.



`git branch [name]` to create a branch of an item
